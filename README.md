# Engineering-and-Math-Writeups
Guides Written From the Perspective of an Electrical Engineer / Applied Mathematics and Statistics Major

  These guides are written based on what I have found useful or could have been better explained during my time as an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University. (At time of writing, I am still studying at Stony Brook.) These writeups will typically be done in LaTeX, and will attempt to explain various concept fundamentals. However, some intution may be sacrificed for being able to solve these problems in general.

  Code used for these problems will typically use either basic C, C++, or Matlab. For circuits, PSPICE will be used to draw and simulate circuits. For digital circuits, Aldec HDL is the program of choice.
  
  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, or perhaps would like to show your appreciation of my work, feel free to contact me at byt1998+writeups@gmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
  
  Thanks for reading!
